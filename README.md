# freescian Bridge Project

While browsing the web, I stumbled upon an article discussing a significant issue. Despite the widespread availability and accessibility of the internet, many people are unaware of the welfare policies they need and struggle with the application process, thus missing out on essential benefits. Moreover, there are educational disparities that arise even before children enter school, leading to unequal opportunities based on age-appropriate education.

I realized that I didn't fully grasp the challenges faced by the elderly and low-income groups. I hadn't considered how social disparities could manifest in this way. This revelation motivated me to start this project.

The name "freescian Bridge" stems from a blend of several concepts. "Free" represents freedom and accessibility; "Priscian" symbolizes the blue of Prussian Blue, an iconic color. In engineering, a bridge connects networks, and in sociology, it signifies strengthening connections between social strata. Thus, the Priscian Bridge website was born.

When developing this project, my primary focus was on ensuring that anyone could easily access the desired information for free. I aimed to create a lightweight platform that anyone could use, regardless of their device's performance or internet speed. The website utilizes only two images, with the rest built using HTML, allowing for quick access even with low-end devices and slow internet connections.

Anyone can use and improve the code for Priscian Bridge, making it a truly collaborative and open-source project.
